# NFT-Marketplace
An NFT marketplace is an online platform where Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are bought, sold, and traded. NFTs are unique digital assets stored on blockchain, representing ownership or proof of authenticity of digital items like art, music, videos, and virtual real estate. Creators mint their NFTs by uploading digital content and assigning unique metadata.
In an NFT marketplace, creators or artists can mint (create) their NFTs by uploading their digital creations and assigning them unique metadata that includes details like title, description, and properties. These NFTs are then tokenized and stored on a blockchain, ensuring their authenticity and provenance. Once minted, creators can list their NFTs for sale, set prices, and choose whether to auction them or sell them at a fixed price.
Buyers browse the marketplace to discover and purchase NFTs using cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. These platforms provide tools for creators to list their NFTs, set prices, and manage sales, while offering collectors a secure environment to acquire unique digital assets.
